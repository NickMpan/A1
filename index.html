		<p class="monospace">I am a 22 year old student living in Melbourne. I am in the process of completing my bachelor of IT and I am also currently working full time in sales. Having lived in Australia my whole life it feels only fitting to call myself an Australian. That being said my mum is from the seychelle islands and my dad is from greece. I am currently in the process of trying to teach myself mandarin with hopes of becoming fluent enough to utilise it in my career ventures. I really enjoy American Football and I am an avid fan of the Las Vegas Raiders in the National Football League and the Ohio state buckeyes in College Football. One of the more recent hobbies I have come across this year is mountain biking, I have recently become infatuated with the sport and it has quickly become one of my favourite (and more painful) pastimes.If you catch me on a day off between work and uni you will most likely find me playing games, hitting trails on my mountain bike, taking my dog cooper to the beach or watching whatever football game is on at the time.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Interest In IT</h1>
		<div class="box">
		<p class="monospace">As a kid, the first console my family owned was a super nintendo and to this day I still remember the amount of time that my parents, sister and I spent trying to complete Super Mario. I have always loved games and have had a constant wonder for how they work. The idea of playing along in a storyline and making my own decisions with no physical consequences has been one of the most enticing aspects of these games, along with the obvious benefits of living a life that is not otherwise offered in reality. Although game design isn't necessarily a career goal for me, games are definitely the biggest aspect of IT that interests me and makes me want to learn more.</p>
	
		<p class="monospace">When completing VCE, I had not gotten the result that I had hoped for that would have gotten me into my first choice school which was in fact RMIT. RMIT had always been incredibly intriguing to me ever since I had gone to the open days. There seemed to be a large amount of emphasis on having an interesting learning environment, especially having a very modern campus in the city. However, at the time I had very little idea in what I had actually wanted to do for a career and had in turn applied for a business degree and planned to figure out my plans along the way. As a result of having no career goals I had not put in enough effort to allow me to study at the uni I had hoped for and my degree quickly became a thing of the past. After not studying for three years, I now begin my somewhat overwhelming journey to change into a different industry and build a career in IT through RMIT.</p>
		
		<p class="monospace">Throughout my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a large amount in different ares of IT to avoid limiting myself to working in a single area. Overall what I am hoping to achieve is not just the ability to be employable but to also be able to understand the way the technology I own works and how to customize it to better suit my needs. Some things in particular that I would like to learn consist of better understanding in computer systems and how they work, cyber-security and how I can prevent breaches and to improve my programming skills. There are many other aspects of IT i would intend on learning abouthowever those are the ones of main interest to me.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Ideal Job</h1> 
		<div class="box">
		<p>When it comes to the area in IT that I would really like to develop my skills and build a career, I currently have it narrowed it down to two options. These options being cybersecurity and a sales-based role, with the latter being the more enjoyable and overall preferred option for me. I have found that sales is a more interesting role to me as I tend to enjoy talking with people and I find it easy to communicate ideas with other people. The job that I hope to progress into relatively soon after my degree is complete is to be working as an account manager/Sales representative for an IT company. What is mainly expected of this role is to be working at ways to aqquire new clients and service current clients in providing them with the most suitable to fit their business needs.</p>
	
		<p>Having a sound knowledge of how these technologies such as Cloud services, different operating systems and a good understanding of different types of CRM and the features that make them stand out more to a client is a skill that would be incredibly helpful to begin this role. More to the point, knowing how different systems, programs and services operate in regards to a business environment and knowing how to cater to individual clients in providing a service that is best suited to their work environment is essentially a large part of what is required by this role. I am currently beginning a retail sales role in the IT industry and have worked in a customer service role my whole working life.</p>
	
		<p>I believe that the current skill that makes me most valuable in any of these customer facing roles is my ability to listen, provide a customer with the most suitable fit to their requirements and most importantly to be fast on my feet when presented with a complication. I currently have a very basic understanding of IT and the technologies that keep the world running. I have high hopes that with the knowledge that I obtain from this course, a better understanding of what a consumer looks for in technology and my improving communication skills that I am receiving from working in a customer facing job everyday will ensure that I am soon qualified enough to begin working in this sort of role or any other role in the IT industry that I may take a liking to in the future.</p>
