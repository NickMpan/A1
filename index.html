		<h3>s3863803@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
		<div class="box">
		<p class="monospace">I am a 22 year old student living in Melbourne. I am in the process of completing my bachelor of IT and I am also currently working full time in sales. Having lived in Australia my whole life it feels only fitting to call myself an Australian. That being said my mum is from the seychelle islands and my dad is from greece. I am currently in the process of trying to teach myself mandarin with hopes of becoming fluent enough to utilise it in my career ventures. I really enjoy American Football and I am an avid fan of the Las Vegas Raiders in the National Football League and the Ohio state buckeyes in College Football. One of the more recent hobbies I have come across this year is mountain biking, I have recently become infatuated with the sport and it has quickly become one of my favourite (and more painful) pastimes.If you catch me on a day off between work and uni you will most likely find me playing games, hitting trails on my mountain bike, taking my dog cooper to the beach or watching whatever football game is on at the time.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Interest In IT</h1>
		
		<div class="box">
		
			<p class="monospace">As a kid, the first console my family owned was a super nintendo and to this day I still remember the amount of time that my parents, sister and I spent trying to complete Super Mario. I have always loved games and have had a constant wonder for how they work. The idea of playing along in a storyline and making my own decisions with no physical consequences has been one of the most enticing aspects of these games, along with the obvious benefits of living a life that is not otherwise offered in reality. Although game design isn't necessarily a career goal for me, games are definitely the biggest aspect of IT that interests me and makes me want to learn more.</p>
	
			<p class="monospace">When completing VCE, I had not gotten the result that I had hoped for that would have gotten me into my first choice school which was in fact RMIT. RMIT had always been incredibly intriguing to me ever since I had gone to the open days. There seemed to be a large amount of emphasis on having an interesting learning environment, especially having a very modern campus in the city. However, at the time I had very little idea in what I had actually wanted to do for a career and had in turn applied for a business degree and planned to figure out my plans along the way. As a result of having no career goals I had not put in enough effort to allow me to study at the uni I had hoped for and my degree quickly became a thing of the past. After not studying for three years, I now begin my somewhat overwhelming journey to change into a different industry and build a career in IT through RMIT.</p>
		
			<p class="monospace">Throughout my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a large amount in different ares of IT to avoid limiting myself to working in a single area. Overall what I am hoping to achieve is not just the ability to be employable but to also be able to understand the way the technology I own works and how to customize it to better suit my needs. Some things in particular that I would like to learn consist of better understanding in computer systems and how they work, cyber-security and how I can prevent breaches and to improve my programming skills. There are many other aspects of IT i would intend on learning abouthowever those are the ones of main interest to me.</p> 
		</div>
		
		<h1 class="thick">Ideal Job</h1> 
		
		<div class="box">
			<p>When it comes to the area in IT that I would really like to develop my skills and build a career, I currently have it narrowed it down to two options. These options being cybersecurity and a sales-based role, with the latter being the more enjoyable and overall preferred option for me. I have found that sales is a more interesting role to me as I tend to enjoy talking with people and I find it easy to communicate ideas with other people. The job that I hope to progress into relatively soon after my degree is complete is to be working as an account manager/Sales representative for an IT company. What is mainly expected of this role is to be working at ways to aqquire new clients and service current clients in providing them with the most suitable to fit their business needs.</p>
	
			<p>Having a sound knowledge of how these technologies such as Cloud services, different operating systems and a good understanding of different types of CRM and the features that make them stand out more to a client is a skill that would be incredibly helpful to begin this role. More to the point, knowing how different systems, programs and services operate in regards to a business environment and knowing how to cater to individual clients in providing a service that is best suited to their work environment is essentially a large part of what is required by this role. I am currently beginning a retail sales role in the IT industry and have worked in a customer service role my whole working life.</p>
	
			<p>I believe that the current skill that makes me most valuable in any of these customer facing roles is my ability to listen, provide a customer with the most suitable fit to their requirements and most importantly to be fast on my feet when presented with a complication. I currently have a very basic understanding of IT and the technologies that keep the world running. I have high hopes that with the knowledge that I obtain from this course, a better understanding of what a consumer looks for in technology and my improving communication skills that I am receiving from working in a customer facing job everyday will ensure that I am soon qualified enough to begin working in this sort of role or any other role in the IT industry that I may take a liking to in the future.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Learning Styles Test</h1>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">In completion of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, I was scored the ENTP personality type. This personality type suggests that I am extroverted, intuitive person with a "thinking" value style and a perceptive life style. As a result of this combination of styles I am overall a lively and energetic person, it also states that I am imaginative, analytical, open-minded and spontaneous. I believe this is an accurate estimation of my personality type as I am quite a friendly and outgoing person with a vast imagination and I have a very spontaneous nature. I am hoping that throughout this course I learn how to use my imagination more when trying to think of project ideas or creative solutions to any issues I come across.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Learning Styles Test</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">According to the learning styles test that I completed, I am 55% an auditory learner, 25% tactile learner and 20% visual learner. I have always learned a lot better from hearing things explained to me and as a result of this I think a good way to really attempt to understand the teachings in this class and the other classes of my bachelors degree, I would benefit from downloading any modules and course recordings and listening to them multiple times while completing other tasks in my day to day life.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Big Five Personality Test</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">My Big Five Personality Test results gave me results that I am relatively confident about as I believe majority of the scales accurately display my nature. In the openness to experience scale I scored right in the middle which essentially suggests that I have a relatively traditional way of thinking in some aspects of life while at the same time being relatively progressive in other aspects. Based on the other scales in this test, the test has essentially just reinforced what the other tests have already indicated which is that I am creative, imaginative and open-minded to most things. Once again it also states that I am spontaneous and to some extent disorganised when it comes to plans and having a set schedule. While all this is an accurate indication of my personality, I believe the most accurate part of the test is that I prefer to work alone and I am not quick to take over leadership of a project preferring to be more a part of the creative process instead. 
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Overall</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">Overall from what I have gathered by my personality and learning styles tests, I am a more agreeable person and I tend to avoid taking leadership roles in a project. Based on this I would be better off looking for a group with someone who has a tendancy to take control of the project and allow myself to spend more time on the creative aspect of the project. It is also wise for me to make sure I participate in any group meetings to allow myself to be up to date with any group decisions and to have a good understanding of what the goals are for the project.<p>

		<h1 class="thick">A Helping Hand</h1>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Overview</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">There is nothing worse than purchasing something that you have been so excited to get only to find that you can't figure out how to configure the settings properly. A helping hand is a great way for those who have a bit of free time and some knowledge in a certain area to pass that on to other people around the world. By teaching someone to do a specific task you are rewarded through your app and after learning something new you then give feedback on the tutorial based on how helpful it was and whether it has accurately addressed the request.</p>  
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Motivation</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">As a 23 year old there ares still a lot of things that I have never gotten around to learning or have no one who can teach me. The reason I believe this app could be incredibly helpful to most people is because there is a large target audience of people who could use it, it can be incredibly appealing to those who have grown up with no role model to teach them certain things that they have wanted to learn. On top of that it allows some more specific tasks to be taugh to you by those who have taken the time to learn these themselves.</p>
