		<h3>s3863803@student.rmit.edu.au</h3>
		<div class="box">
		<p class="monospace">I am a 22 year old student living in Melbourne. I am in the process of completing my bachelor of IT and I am also currently working full time in sales. Having lived in Australia my whole life it feels only fitting to call myself an Australian. That being said my mum is from the seychelle islands and my dad is from greece. I am currently in the process of trying to teach myself mandarin with hopes of becoming fluent enough to utilise it in my career ventures. I really enjoy American Football and I am an avid fan of the Las Vegas Raiders in the National Football League and the Ohio state buckeyes in College Football. One of the more recent hobbies I have come across this year is mountain biking, I have recently become infatuated with the sport and it has quickly become one of my favourite (and more painful) pastimes.If you catch me on a day off between work and uni you will most likely find me playing games, hitting trails on my mountain bike, taking my dog cooper to the beach or watching whatever football game is on at the time.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Interest In IT</h1>
		
		<div class="box">
		
			<p class="monospace">As a kid, the first console my family owned was a super nintendo and to this day I still remember the amount of time that my parents, sister and I spent trying to complete Super Mario. I have always loved games and have had a constant wonder for how they work. The idea of playing along in a storyline and making my own decisions with no physical consequences has been one of the most enticing aspects of these games, along with the obvious benefits of living a life that is not otherwise offered in reality. Although game design isn't necessarily a career goal for me, games are definitely the biggest aspect of IT that interests me and makes me want to learn more.</p>
	
			<p class="monospace">When completing VCE, I had not gotten the result that I had hoped for that would have gotten me into my first choice school which was in fact RMIT. RMIT had always been incredibly intriguing to me ever since I had gone to the open days. There seemed to be a large amount of emphasis on having an interesting learning environment, especially having a very modern campus in the city. However, at the time I had very little idea in what I had actually wanted to do for a career and had in turn applied for a business degree and planned to figure out my plans along the way. As a result of having no career goals I had not put in enough effort to allow me to study at the uni I had hoped for and my degree quickly became a thing of the past. After not studying for three years, I now begin my somewhat overwhelming journey to change into a different industry and build a career in IT through RMIT.</p>
		
			<p class="monospace">Throughout my studies at RMIT, I am hoping to learn a large amount in different ares of IT to avoid limiting myself to working in a single area. Overall what I am hoping to achieve is not just the ability to be employable but to also be able to understand the way the technology I own works and how to customize it to better suit my needs. Some things in particular that I would like to learn consist of better understanding in computer systems and how they work, cyber-security and how I can prevent breaches and to improve my programming skills. There are many other aspects of IT i would intend on learning abouthowever those are the ones of main interest to me.</p> 
		</div>
		
		<h1 class="thick">Ideal Job</h1> 
		
		<div class="box">
			<p>When it comes to the area in IT that I would really like to develop my skills and build a career, I currently have it narrowed it down to two options. These options being cybersecurity and a sales-based role, with the latter being the more enjoyable and overall preferred option for me. I have found that sales is a more interesting role to me as I tend to enjoy talking with people and I find it easy to communicate ideas with other people. The job that I hope to progress into relatively soon after my degree is complete is to be working as an account manager/Sales representative for an IT company. What is mainly expected of this role is to be working at ways to aqquire new clients and service current clients in providing them with the most suitable to fit their business needs.</p>
	
			<p>Having a sound knowledge of how these technologies such as Cloud services, different operating systems and a good understanding of different types of CRM and the features that make them stand out more to a client is a skill that would be incredibly helpful to begin this role. More to the point, knowing how different systems, programs and services operate in regards to a business environment and knowing how to cater to individual clients in providing a service that is best suited to their work environment is essentially a large part of what is required by this role. I am currently beginning a retail sales role in the IT industry and have worked in a customer service role my whole working life.</p>
	
			<p>I believe that the current skill that makes me most valuable in any of these customer facing roles is my ability to listen, provide a customer with the most suitable fit to their requirements and most importantly to be fast on my feet when presented with a complication. I currently have a very basic understanding of IT and the technologies that keep the world running. I have high hopes that with the knowledge that I obtain from this course, a better understanding of what a consumer looks for in technology and my improving communication skills that I am receiving from working in a customer facing job everyday will ensure that I am soon qualified enough to begin working in this sort of role or any other role in the IT industry that I may take a liking to in the future.</p>

		<h1 class="thick">Learning Styles Test</h1>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">In completion of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator test, I was scored the ENTP personality type. This personality type suggests that I am extroverted, intuitive person with a "thinking" value style and a perceptive life style. As a result of this combination of styles I am overall a lively and energetic person, it also states that I am imaginative, analytical, open-minded and spontaneous. I believe this is an accurate estimation of my personality type as I am quite a friendly and outgoing person with a vast imagination and I have a very spontaneous nature. I am hoping that throughout this course I learn how to use my imagination more when trying to think of project ideas or creative solutions to any issues I come across.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Learning Styles Test</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">According to the learning styles test that I completed, I am 55% an auditory learner, 25% tactile learner and 20% visual learner. I have always learned a lot better from hearing things explained to me and as a result of this I think a good way to really attempt to understand the teachings in this class and the other classes of my bachelors degree, I would benefit from downloading any modules and course recordings and listening to them multiple times while completing other tasks in my day to day life.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Big Five Personality Test</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">My Big Five Personality Test results gave me results that I am relatively confident about as I believe majority of the scales accurately display my nature. In the openness to experience scale I scored right in the middle which essentially suggests that I have a relatively traditional way of thinking in some aspects of life while at the same time being relatively progressive in other aspects. Based on the other scales in this test, the test has essentially just reinforced what the other tests have already indicated which is that I am creative, imaginative and open-minded to most things. Once again it also states that I am spontaneous and to some extent disorganised when it comes to plans and having a set schedule. While all this is an accurate indication of my personality, I believe the most accurate part of the test is that I prefer to work alone and I am not quick to take over leadership of a project preferring to be more a part of the creative process instead. </p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Overall</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">Overall from what I have gathered by my personality and learning styles tests, I am a more agreeable person and I tend to avoid taking leadership roles in a project. Based on this I would be better off looking for a group with someone who has a tendancy to take control of the project and allow myself to spend more time on the creative aspect of the project. It is also wise for me to make sure I participate in any group meetings to allow myself to be up to date with any group decisions and to have a good understanding of what the goals are for the project.<p>
		</div>
		
		<h1 class="thick">A Helping Hand</h1>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Overview</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">There is nothing worse than purchasing something that you have been so excited to get only to find that you can't figure out how to configure the settings properly. A helping hand is a great way for those who have a bit of free time and some knowledge in a certain area to pass that on to other people around the world. By teaching someone to do a specific task you are rewarded through your app and after learning something new you then give feedback on the tutorial based on how helpful it was and whether it has accurately addressed the request.</p>  
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Motivation</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">As a 23 year old there ares still a lot of things that I have never gotten around to learning or have no one who can teach me. The reason I believe this app could be incredibly helpful to most people is because there is a large target audience of people who could use it, it can be incredibly appealing to those who have grown up with no role model to teach them certain things that they have wanted to learn. On top of that it allows some more specific tasks to be taugh to you by those who have taken the time to learn these themselves.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Description</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">The app will request a signup the same way any other social media platform would. When signing up, the user can register any qualifications that they have such as a Bachelor in IT or a Certificate in Carpentry which can be verified by the user to make any advice that is given more credible. Keep in mind that a degree or qualification is not required to make comments however people will be more likely to take advice from a qualified person. After the user creates an account can then make a post requesting help from other people in a completing a task. The task can be anything from "what is the best way to clean this stain from my shirt?" to "How can I train my dog to stop urinating in the house?". After asking a question the original poster will receive notifications for any comments received on their post and can hopefully take the next step to rectifying the issues that they face.</p>
			
			<p class="monospace">After completing registration with the app, the user can select multiple categories that they have knowledge on and will in turn have posts sorted based on their relevant qualifications and then displayed on their feed. When a user runs out of posts to be seen they can then look through other general requests to see if they can help in any other way. When a user is planning on giving advice to a poster, they can choose to post either step-by-step instructions as a comment or they can post a video to show a demonstration of how to do this specific task. The benefit to posting a video response is that it makes it easier to show how to perform this task. Say for example I would like to know how to take my bike chain off for cleaning and maintenance. I would be able to post a request with the hopes of someone posting a video showing the specific tools required and how to use the tools to take the bike chain off.</p>
			
			<p class="monospace">In addition to any advice already given, the original poster can then contact the commenter through direct message and ask any questions about the advice given with hopes of getting more information on the instructions. The direct message feature allows for the users to elaborate on advice, ask questions and also organise another method of contact such as a video call to have face to face instructions. When a user comments advice on a post, the original poster can then review this advice and give a one to five star rating based on how helpful the advice was. This rating is then averaged and displayed as an overall rating on the users profile for others to view when determining how trustworthy the advice is. </p>  
		</div>
		<h2 class="thick">Tools and Technologies</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">The app will run like most other social media services do. It will run on a set of servers that will store all information and allow people to access it based on privacy settings. Any videos posted by a user in response to a comment will need to be stored on the servers for use by anyone who views the original post. Due to having certain confidential information, the servers will need to be incredibly secure and all passwords, email addresses and other sensitive information entered by a user will need to be automatically censored.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Skills Required</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">When designing the app there are many online builders that could be used to build the social media site however assuming we are building the website from scratch ourselves, we would need to use both HTML and CSS to personalise the website and do the basic design. Knowledge in server side programming would also be required, therefore use of a server side programming language such as PHP would be necessary to ensure that all privacy and security requirements are met to ensure that the website database is secure against any breaches.</p>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="thick">Outcome</h2>
		
		<div class="box">
			<p class="monospace">The overall hopes for this social media platform is that there is a large number of users across the world to help people in different places. When progressing with this app, advertising can be used to increase revenue as a main source of income to ensure that the app can be consistently maintained to ensure security standards are upheld. If a large enough number of users is gained, the ideal outcome is for a reward to be given to users on a monthly basis for those who have a large amount of positive reviews and consistently helpful comments.</p>
